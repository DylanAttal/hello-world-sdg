### Summary

This webpage was my first project at Suncoast Developers Guild! We were instructed to create a basic webpage about a hobby using text and images. This was an introduction to semantic HTML tags like `header` and `footer` that help developers organize content meaningfully. This was also an introduction to CSS flexbox, which I found to be very helpful with centering images within `div`s.

### Project Goals
