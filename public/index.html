    <h1>How I got into Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</h1>
  </header>
  <div id="top-div">
    <p>Growing up, I never much enjoyed sports. My parents threw me into
      every sport with a team and a ball, but none of them stuck. I
      ended up swimming competitively for more than a decade, though,
      simply because it was the sport that my brother loved and it was
      easy for my mom to drop us off at the same practice. Did I care
      if I got beat in a race? Absolutely not. But it kept me in shape
      and gave me a nice tan, so I swam.
    </p>
    <p>Fast forward to college graduation. I moved back to my hometown
      of Tampa, and I needed a way to stay fit. I had long since stopped
      swimming, and returning to the pool was not an option. Going to
      the gym alone was so boring. I craved a new experience as I embarked
      on a new chapter in my life. This was during the heyday of Ronda
      Rousey, a Judo-trained UFC fighter who went two and a half years
      undefeated and who holds the record as the longest reigning
      UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion. By chance, I saw her fight
      while I was out for drinks at a bar. She was incredible.
      The short, beautiful blonde had everyone in the bar standing,
      applauding, and yelling. I've never been excited for watching
      a sports match before. I go for the wings and beer. But that night
      I was pounding the table like everyone else, and when that fervor
      took me by surprise, I thought <em>I've got to learn how to do that</em>.

    <p>I'm a bookworm. I'm a nerd trapped in an athlete's body. I had
      literally never gotten into a physical altercation before--not
      even a scuffle at lunch in middle school. So suffice it to say I
      was nervous walking into a martial arts studio for the first time.
      But I had decided to learn a new skill, and I'm nothing if not
      determined. Luckily, I lived near a studio with an amazing sensei.
      Ryan Deichert is a Gracie Jiu Jitsu Black Belt who studied under
      the legendary Royce Gracie and opened his own studio in Tampa. He's a
      down-to-earth, humble guy who you'd never suspect could rip you apart
      like a grizzly bear. The students at Tampa Jiu Jitsu were
      similarly welcoming, and despite getting tapped by literal
      high-schoolers every night, I persevered in my training. Before I
      knew it a half a year had passed, everyone knew my name, and I had
      found a community.
